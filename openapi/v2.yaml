  title: Lunch Money API - v2
  description: |-
    Welcome to the Lunch Money v2 API.

    A working version of this API is now available through these docs, or directly at:

    `https://api.lunchmoney.dev/v2`

    <span class="red-text"><strong>This is in alpha launch of a major API update. It is still subject to change during this alpha review 
    period and bugs may still exist. Users are strongly encouraged to use the mock service or to create a test budget with example data as the first step to interacting with the v2 API.</strong></span>
    See the [Getting Started Guide](https://alpha.lunchmoney.dev/v2/getting-started) for more information on using a test budget.<br<br>

    If you are new to the v2 API, you may wish to review the [v2 API Overview of Changes](https://alpha.lunchmoney.dev/v2/changelog).

    ### Static Mock Server

    You may also use these docs to explore the API using a static mock server endpoint.<p> 
    This enables users to become familiar with the API without having to create an access token, and eliminates the possibility of modifying real data. <p>
    To access this endpoint select the second endpoint in the the "Server" dropdown to the right. When selected you should see "Static Mock v2 Lunch Money API Server".<br>
    When using this server, set your Bearer token to any string with 11 or more characters.

    ### Migrating from V1

    The v2 API is NOT backwards compatible with the v1 API. Developers are encouraged to review the [Migration Guide](https://alpha.lunchmoney.dev/v2/migration-guide) to understand the changes and plan their migration.

    ### Acknowledgments

    If you have been providing feedback on the API during our iterative design process, **THANK YOU**. We are happy to provide the opportunity to finally interact with the working API that was built based on your feedback.

        Modifies the properties of an existing category or category group.<br><br>
        
        You may submit the response from a `GET /categories/{id}` as the request body; however, only certain
        properties can be updated using this API. The following properties are
        accepted in the request body but their values will be ignored: `id`, `is_group`,`archived_at`, `updated_at`, `created_at`, and `order`.<br><br>

        It is also possible to provide only the properties to be updated in the
        request body, as long as the request includes at least one of the
        properties that is not listed above. For example, a request body that contains only a `name` property is valid.<br><br>

        It is not possible to use this API to convert a category to a category group, or a vice versa, so while submitting a request body with the `is_group` property is tolerated, it will result in an error response if the value is changed.<br><br>

        It is possible to modify the children of an existing category group with this API by setting the `children` attribute. If this is set, it will replace the existing children with the newly specified children. If the intention is to add or remove a single category, it is more straightforward to update the child category by specifying the new `group_id` attribute. If the goal is to add multiple new children or remove multiple existing children, it is recommended to first call the `GET /categories/:id` endpoint to get the existing children and then modify the list as desired.<br><br>

        properties can be updated using this API. The following system set properties are
        accepted in the request body but their values will be ignored: `id`, `to_base`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`.<br><br>

        It is also possible to provide only the properties to be updated in the
        request body, as long as the request includes at least one of the
        properties that is not listed above. For example a request body that contains only a `name` property is valid.<br><br>

      summary: Trigger Fetch from Plaid
      description: >-
        Use this endpoint to trigger a fetch for latest data from Plaid.<br><br>

        Eligible accounts are those who last_fetch value is over 1 minute ago.
        (Although the limit is every minute, please use this endpoint
        sparingly!) Successive calls to this endpoint under a minute after the
        first will return a 425 TOO EARLY response.<br><br>

        Successful calls will return a 202 ACCEPTED response. Note that fetching
        from Plaid is a background job. This endpoint simply queues up the job.
        You may track the `plaid_last_successful_update`, `last_fetch` and
        `last_import` properties to verify the results of the fetch. The `last
        fetch` property is updated when Plaid accepts a request to fetch data.
        The `plaid_last_successful_update`is updated when it successfully
        contacts the associated financial institution. The `last_import` field
        is updated only when new transactions have been imported.

      summary: Update multiple transactions
      description: >-
        Modifies the properties of multiple existing transactions in a single request.<br><br>
        
        You may submit complete transaction objects from the response returned by a `GET /transactions` in the request body for each transaction, however only certain
        properties can be updated using this API. The following system set properties are
        accepted in the request body, but their values will be ignored: `id`, `to_base`, `is_pending`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `source`, and `plaid_metadata`.<br><br>
        
        Transactions that have been previously split or grouped may not be
        modified by this endpoint. Therefore the `is_split_parent`, `split_parent_id`, `is_group_parent`, `group_parent_id`, and `children` properties are also ignored when provided in the request body.<br><br>

        Each transaction in the array **must** include an `id` property to identify which transaction to update, along with at least one other property to be updated. For example, a transaction object that contains only an `id` and `category_id` property is valid.<br><br>
        
        The request can include between 1 and 500 transactions to update in a single call.

        You may submit the response from a `GET /transactions/{id}` as the request body, however only certain
        properties can be updated using this API. The following system set properties are
        accepted in the request body but their values will be ignored: `id`, `to_base`, `is_pending`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `source`, and `plaid_metadata`.<br><br>
        
        Transactions that have been previously split or grouped may not be
        modified by this endpoint. Therefore the `is_split_parent`, `split_parent_id`, `is_group_parent`, `group_parent_id`, and `children` properties are also ignored when provided in the request body.<br><br>

        It is also possible to provide only the properties to be updated in the
        request body, as long as the request includes at least one of the
        properties that is not listed above. For example a request body that contains only
        an `category_id` attribute is valid.

        You may submit the response from a `GET /tags/{id}` as the request body, however only certain
        properties can be updated using this API. The following system set properties are
        accepted in the request body but their values will be ignored: `id`, `updated_at`, `created_at`, and `archived_at`.<br><br>

        It is also possible to provide only the properties to be updated in the
        request body, as long as the request includes at least one of the
        properties that is not listed above. For example a request body that contains only a
        `name` attribute is valid.
