# Toys is a configurable command line tool. Write commands in config files
# using a simple DSL, and Toys will provide the command line executable and
# take care of all the details such as argument parsing, online help, and error
# reporting. Toys is designed for software developers, IT professionals, and
# other power users who want to write and organize scripts to automate their
# workflows. It can also be used as a Rake replacement, providing a more
# natural command line interface for your project's build tasks.
#
# This module contains the command line framework underlying Toys. It can be
# used to create command line executables using the Toys DSL and classes.
#
# ## Common starting points
#
# Some of the most commonly needed class documentation is listed below:
#
# * For information on the DSL used to write tools, start with
#   {Toys::DSL::Tool}.
# * The base class for tool runtime (i.e. that defines the basic methods
#   available to a tool's implementation) is {Toys::Context}.
# * For information on writing mixins, see {Toys::Mixin}.
# * For information on writing templates, see {Toys::Template}.
# * For information on writing acceptors, see {Toys::Acceptor}.
# * For information on writing custom shell completions, see {Toys::Completion}.
# * Standard mixins are defined under the {Toys::StandardMixins} module.
# * Various utilities are defined under {Toys::Utils}. Some of these serve as
#   the implementations of corresponding mixins.
# * The main entrypoint for the command line framework is {Toys::CLI}.
#
# Other important internal classes are listed below.
#
# * The definition of a tool is represented by {Toys::ToolDefinition} along
#   the helpers {Toys::Flag}, {Toys::PositionalArg}, and {Toys::FlagGroup}.
# * Argument parsing is implemented by {Toys::ArgParser}.
# * The process of finding and loading a tool definition given a tool name, is
#   implemented by {Toys::Loader}.
# * Text wrapping is handled by {Toys::WrappableString}.
# * The settings system is implemented by {Toys::Settings}.

    # This method returns a base class for defining a tool with a given name.
    # This is useful if the naming behavior of {Toys::Tool} is not adequate for
    # your tool.

# An Acceptor validates and converts arguments. It is designed to be
# compatible with the OptionParser accept mechanism.
#
# First, an acceptor validates the argument via its
# {Toys::Acceptor::Base#match} method. This method should determine whether
# the argument is valid, and return information that will help with
# conversion of the argument.
#
# Second, an acceptor converts the argument to its final form via the
# {Toys::Acceptor::Base#convert} method.
#
# Finally, an acceptor has a name that may appear in help text for flags and
# arguments that use it.
#
# source://toys-core//lib/toys/acceptor.rb#19
module Toys::Acceptor
  class << self
    # Create an acceptor from a variety of specification formats. The
    # acceptor is constructed from the given specification object and/or the
    # given block. Additionally, some acceptors can take an optional type
    # description string used to describe the type of data in online help.
    #
    # Recognized specs include:
    #
    #  *  Any well-known acceptor recognized by OptionParser, such as
    #     `Integer`, `Array`, or `OptionParser::DecimalInteger`. Any block
    #     and type description you provide are ignored.
    #
    #  *  Any **regular expression**. The returned acceptor validates only if
    #     the regex matches the *entire string parameter*.
    #
    #     You can also provide an optional conversion function as a block. If
    #     provided, the block must take a variable number of arguments, the
    #     first being the matched string and the remainder being the captures
    #     from the regular expression. It should return the converted object
    #     that will be stored in the context data. If you do not provide a
    #     block, no conversion takes place, and the original string is used.
    #
    #  *  An **array** of possible values. The acceptor validates if the
    #     string parameter matches the *string form* of one of the array
    #     elements (i.e. the results of calling `to_s` on the element.)
    #
    #     An array acceptor automatically converts the string parameter to
    #     the actual array element that it matched. For example, if the
    #     symbol `:foo` is in the array, it will match the string `"foo"`,
    #     and then store the symbol `:foo` in the tool data. You may not
    #     further customize the conversion function; any block is ignored.
    #
    #  *  A **range** of possible values. The acceptor validates if the
    #     string parameter, after conversion to the range type, lies within
    #     the range. The final value stored in context data is the converted
    #     value. For numeric ranges, conversion is provided, but if the range
    #     has a different type, you must provide the conversion function as
    #     a block.
    #
    #  *  A **function** as a Proc (where the block is ignored) or a block
    #     (if the spec is nil). This function performs *both* validation and
    #     conversion. It should take the string parameter as its argument,
    #     and it must either return the object that should be stored in the
    #     tool data, or raise an exception (descended from `StandardError`)
    #     to indicate that the string parameter is invalid. You may also
    #     return the sentinel value {Toys::Acceptor::REJECT} to indicate that
    #     the string is invalid.
    #
    #  *  The value `nil` or `:default` with no block, to indicate the
    #     default pass-through acceptor {Toys::Acceptor::DEFAULT}. Any type
    #     description you provide is ignored.
    #
    # Additional options:
    #
    #  *  `:type_desc` (String) The type description for interpolating into
    #     help text. Ignored if the spec indicates the default acceptor or a
    #     well-known acceptor.
    #
    # @param block [Proc] See the description for recognized forms.

# A Toys-based CLI.
#
# This is the entry point for command line execution. It includes the set of
# tool definitions (and/or information on how to load them from the file
# system), configuration parameters such as logging and error handling, and a
# method to call to invoke a command.
#
# This is the class to instantiate to create a Toys-based command line
# executable. For example:
#
#     #!/usr/bin/env ruby
#     require "toys-core"
#     cli = Toys::CLI.new
#     cli.add_config_block do
#       def run
#         puts "Hello, world!"
#       end
#     end
#     exit(cli.run(*ARGV))
#
# The currently running CLI is also available at runtime, and can be used by
# tools that want to invoke other tools. For example:
#
#     # My .toys.rb
#     tool "foo" do
#       def run
#         puts "in foo"
#       end
#     end
#     tool "bar" do
#       def run
#         puts "in bar"
#         cli.run "foo"
#       end
#     end
#
# source://toys-core//lib/toys/cli.rb#41
class Toys::CLI
  # Create a CLI.
  #
  # Most configuration parameters (besides tool definitions and tool lookup
  # paths) are set as options passed to the constructor. These options fall
  # roughly into four categories:
  #
  #  *  Options affecting output behavior:
  #      *  `logger`: A global logger for all tools to use
  #      *  `logger_factory`: A proc that returns a logger to use
  #      *  `base_level`: The default log level
  #      *  `error_handler`: Callback for handling exceptions
  #      *  `executable_name`: The name of the executable
  #  *  Options affecting tool specification
  #      *  `extra_delimibers`: Tool name delimiters besides space
  #      *  `completion`: Tab completion handler
  #  *  Options affecting tool definition
  #      *  `middleware_stack`: The middleware applied to all tools
  #      *  `mixin_lookup`: Where to find well-known mixins
  #      *  `middleware_lookup`: Where to find well-known middleware
  #      *  `template_lookup`: Where to find well-known templates
  #  *  Options affecting tool files and directories
  #      *  `config_dir_name`: Directory name containing tool files
  #      *  `config_file_name`: File name for tools
  #      *  `index_file_name`: Name of index files in tool directories
  #      *  `preload_file_name`: Name of preload files in tool directories
  #      *  `preload_dir_name`: Name of preload directories in tool directories
  #      *  `data_dir_name`: Name of data directories in tool directories
  #
  # @param base_level [Integer] The logger level that should correspond
  #   to zero verbosity.
  #   Optional. If not provided, defaults to the current level of the
  #   logger (which is often `Logger::WARN`).
  # @param completion [Toys::Completion::Base] A specifier for shell tab
  #   completion for the CLI as a whole.
  #   Optional. If not provided, {Toys::CLI.default_completion} is called
  #   to get a default completion that delegates to the tool.
  # @param config_dir_name [String] A directory with this name that appears
  #   in the loader path, is treated as a configuration directory whose
  #   contents are loaded into the toys configuration.
  #   Optional. If not provided, toplevel configuration directories are
  #   disabled.
  #   Note: the standard toys executable sets this to `".toys"`.
  # @param config_file_name [String] A file with this name that appears in
  #   the loader path, is treated as a toplevel configuration file whose
  #   contents are loaded into the toys configuration. This does not
  #   include "index" configuration files located within a configuration
  #   directory.
  #   Optional. If not provided, toplevel configuration files are disabled.
  #   Note: the standard toys executable sets this to `".toys.rb"`.
  # @param data_dir_name [String] A directory with this name that appears in
  #   any configuration directory is added to the data directory search
  #   path for any tool file in that directory.
  #   Optional. If not provided, data directories are disabled.
  #   Note: the standard toys executable sets this to `".data"`.
  # @param error_handler [Proc, nil] A proc that is called when an unhandled
  #   exception (a normal exception subclassing `StandardError`, an error
  #   loading a toys config file subclassing `SyntaxError`, or an unhandled
  #   signal subclassing `SignalException`) is detected. The proc should
  #   take a {Toys::ContextualError}, whose cause is the unhandled
  #   exception, as the sole argument, and report the error. It should
  #   return an exit code (normally nonzero) appropriate to the error.
  #   Optional. If not provided, {Toys::CLI.default_error_handler} is
  #   called to get a basic default handler.
  # @param executable_name [String] The executable name displayed in help
  #   text. Optional. Defaults to the ruby program name.
  # @param extra_delimiters [String] A string containing characters that can
  #   function as delimiters in a tool name. Defaults to empty. Allowed
  #   characters are period, colon, and slash.
  # @param index_file_name [String] A file with this name that appears in any
  #   configuration directory is loaded first as a standalone configuration
  #   file. This does not include "toplevel" configuration files outside
  #   configuration directories.
  #   Optional. If not provided, index configuration files are disabled.
  #   Note: the standard toys executable sets this to `".toys.rb"`.
  # @param lib_dir_name [String] A directory with this name that appears in
  #   any configuration directory is added to the Ruby load path when
  #   executing any tool file in that directory.
  #   Optional. If not provided, lib directories are disabled.
  #   Note: the standard toys executable sets this to `".lib"`.
  # @param logger [Logger] A global logger to use for all tools. This can be
  #   set if the CLI will call at most one tool at a time. However, it will
  #   behave incorrectly if CLI might run multiple tools at the same time
  #   with different verbosity settings (since the logger cannot have
  #   multiple level settings simultaneously). In that case, do not set a
  #   global logger, but use the `logger_factory` parameter instead.
  # @param logger_factory [Proc] A proc that takes a {Toys::ToolDefinition}
  #   as an argument, and returns a `Logger` to use when running that tool.
  #   Optional. If not provided (and no global logger is set),
  #   {Toys::CLI.default_logger_factory} is called to get a basic default.
  # @param middleware_lookup [Toys::ModuleLookup] A lookup for well-known
  #   middleware classes.
  #   Optional. If not provided, defaults to the set of standard middleware
  #   classes provided by toys-core, as defined by
  #   {Toys::CLI.default_middleware_lookup}. If you explicitly want no
  #   standard middleware, pass an empty instance of
  #   {Toys::ModuleLookup}.
  # @param middleware_stack [Array<Toys::Middleware::Spec>] An array of
  #   middleware that will be used by default for all tools.
  #   Optional. If not provided, uses a default set of middleware defined
  #   in {Toys::CLI.default_middleware_stack}. To include no middleware,
  #   pass the empty array explicitly.
  # @param mixin_lookup [Toys::ModuleLookup] A lookup for well-known mixin
  #   modules (i.e. with symbol names).
  #   Optional. If not provided, defaults to the set of standard mixins
  #   provided by toys-core, as defined by
  #   {Toys::CLI.default_mixin_lookup}. If you explicitly want no standard
  #   mixins, pass an empty instance of {Toys::ModuleLookup}.
  # @param preload_dir_name [String] A directory with this name that appears
  #   in any configuration directory is searched for Ruby files, which are
  #   preloaded using `require` before any tools in that configuration
  #   directory are defined. Files in a preload directory include normal
  #   Ruby code, rather than Toys DSL definitions. Files in a preload
  #   directory are loaded after any standalone preload file.
  #   Optional. If not provided, preload directories are disabled.
  #   Note: the standard toys executable sets this to `".preload"`.
  # @param preload_file_name [String] A file with this name that appears
  #   in any configuration directory is preloaded using `require` before
  #   any tools in that configuration directory are defined. A preload file
  #   includes normal Ruby code, rather than Toys DSL definitions. The
  #   preload file is loaded before any files in a preload directory.
  #   Optional. If not provided, preload files are disabled.
  #   Note: the standard toys executable sets this to `".preload.rb"`.

    #
    #  *  `:empty`: Returns the empty completion. Any block or options are

# This is the base class for tool execution. It represents `self` when your
# tool's methods (such as `run`) are called, and it defines the methods that
# can be called by your tool (such as {#logger} and {#exit}.)
#
# This class also manages the "data" available to your tool when it runs.
# This data is a hash of key-value pairs. It consists of values set by flags
# and arguments defined by the tool, plus some "well-known" values such as
# the logger and verbosity level.
#
# You can obtain a value from the data using the {Toys::Context#get} method.
# Additionally, convenience methods are provided for many of the well-known
# keys. For instance, you can call {Toys::Context#verbosity} to obtain the
# value for the key {Toys::Context::Key::VERBOSITY}. Finally, flags and
# positional arguments that store their data here will also typically
# generate convenience methods. For example, an argument with key `:abc` will

  # The description is a {Toys::WrappableString}, which may be word-wrapped
  # when displayed in a help screen. You may pass a {Toys::WrappableString}
  # directly to this method, or you may pass any input that can be used to
  # construct a wrappable string:
  #
  #  *  If you pass a String, its whitespace will be compacted (i.e. tabs,
  #     newlines, and multiple consecutive whitespace will be turned into a
  #     single space), and it will be word-wrapped on whitespace.
  #  *  If you pass an Array of Strings, each string will be considered a
  #     literal word that cannot be broken, and wrapping will be done
  #     across the strings in the array. In this case, whitespace is not
  #     compacted.
  #
  # ### Examples
  #
  # If you pass in a sentence as a simple string, it may be word wrapped
  # when displayed:
  #
  #     desc "This sentence may be wrapped."
  #
  # To specify a sentence that should never be word-wrapped, pass it as the

  # Add flags in OptionParser format. This may be called multiple times,

  #
  # Following are examples of valid syntax.
  #
  #  *  `-a` : A short boolean switch. When this appears as an argument,
  #     the value is set to `true`.
  #  *  `--abc` : A long boolean switch. When this appears as an argument,
  #     the value is set to `true`.
  #  *  `-aVAL` or `-a VAL` : A short flag that takes a required value.
  #     These two forms are treated identically. If this argument appears
  #     with a value attached (e.g. `-afoo`), the attached string (e.g.
  #     `"foo"`) is taken as the value. Otherwise, the following argument
  #     is taken as the value (e.g. for `-a foo`, the value is set to
  #     `"foo"`.) The following argument is treated as the value even if it
  #     looks like a flag (e.g. `-a -a` causes the string `"-a"` to be
  #     taken as the value.)
  #  *  `-a[VAL]` : A short flag that takes an optional value. If this
  #     argument appears with a value attached (e.g. `-afoo`), the attached
  #     string (e.g. `"foo"`) is taken as the value. Otherwise, the value
  #     is set to `true`. The following argument is never interpreted as
  #     the value. (Compare with `-a [VAL]`.)
  #  *  `-a [VAL]` : A short flag that takes an optional value. If this
  #     argument appears with a value attached (e.g. `-afoo`), the attached
  #     string (e.g. `"foo"`) is taken as the value. Otherwise, if the
  #     following argument does not look like a flag (i.e. it does not
  #     begin with a hyphen), it is taken as the value. (e.g. `-a foo`
  #     causes the string `"foo"` to be taken as the value.). If there is
  #     no following argument, or the following argument looks like a flag,
  #     the value is set to `true`. (Compare with `-a[VAL]`.)
  #  *  `--abc=VAL` or `--abc VAL` : A long flag that takes a required
  #     value. These two forms are treated identically. If this argument
  #     appears with a value attached (e.g. `--abc=foo`), the attached
  #     string (e.g. `"foo"`) is taken as the value. Otherwise, the
  #     following argument is taken as the value (e.g. for `--abc foo`, the
  #     value is set to `"foo"`.) The following argument is treated as the
  #     value even if it looks like a flag (e.g. `--abc --def` causes the
  #     string `"--def"` to be taken as the value.)
  #  *  `--abc[=VAL]` : A long flag that takes an optional value. If this
  #     argument appears with a value attached (e.g. `--abc=foo`), the
  #     attached string (e.g. `"foo"`) is taken as the value. Otherwise,
  #     the value is set to `true`. The following argument is never
  #     interpreted as the value. (Compare with `--abc [VAL]`.)
  #  *  `--abc [VAL]` : A long flag that takes an optional value. If this
  #     argument appears with a value attached (e.g. `--abc=foo`), the
  #     attached string (e.g. `"foo"`) is taken as the value. Otherwise, if
  #     the following argument does not look like a flag (i.e. it does not
  #     begin with a hyphen), it is taken as the value. (e.g. `--abc foo`
  #     causes the string `"foo"` to be taken as the value.). If there is
  #     no following argument, or the following argument looks like a flag,
  #     the value is set to `true`. (Compare with `--abc=[VAL]`.)
  #  *  `--[no-]abc` : A long boolean switch that can be turned either on
  #     or off. This effectively creates two flags, `--abc` which sets the
  #     value to `true`, and `--no-abc` which sets the falue to `false`.

  # helper method is automatically added to retrieve the value. Otherwise,

  #
  # Attributes of the flag may be passed in as arguments to this method, or
  # set in a block passed to this method. If you provide a block, you can
  # use directives in {Toys::DSL::Flag} within the block.
  #
  # ### Flag syntax
  #
  # The flags themselves should be provided in OptionParser form. Following
  # are examples of valid syntax.
  #
  #  *  `-a` : A short boolean switch. When this appears as an argument,
  #     the value is set to `true`.
  #  *  `--abc` : A long boolean switch. When this appears as an argument,
  #     the value is set to `true`.
  #  *  `-aVAL` or `-a VAL` : A short flag that takes a required value.
  #     These two forms are treated identically. If this argument appears
  #     with a value attached (e.g. `-afoo`), the attached string (e.g.
  #     `"foo"`) is taken as the value. Otherwise, the following argument
  #     is taken as the value (e.g. for `-a foo`, the value is set to
  #     `"foo"`.) The following argument is treated as the value even if it
  #     looks like a flag (e.g. `-a -a` causes the string `"-a"` to be
  #     taken as the value.)
  #  *  `-a[VAL]` : A short flag that takes an optional value. If this
  #     argument appears with a value attached (e.g. `-afoo`), the attached
  #     string (e.g. `"foo"`) is taken as the value. Otherwise, the value
  #     is set to `true`. The following argument is never interpreted as
  #     the value. (Compare with `-a [VAL]`.)
  #  *  `-a [VAL]` : A short flag that takes an optional value. If this
  #     argument appears with a value attached (e.g. `-afoo`), the attached
  #     string (e.g. `"foo"`) is taken as the value. Otherwise, if the
  #     following argument does not look like a flag (i.e. it does not
  #     begin with a hyphen), it is taken as the value. (e.g. `-a foo`
  #     causes the string `"foo"` to be taken as the value.). If there is
  #     no following argument, or the following argument looks like a flag,
  #     the value is set to `true`. (Compare with `-a[VAL]`.)
  #  *  `--abc=VAL` or `--abc VAL` : A long flag that takes a required
  #     value. These two forms are treated identically. If this argument
  #     appears with a value attached (e.g. `--abc=foo`), the attached
  #     string (e.g. `"foo"`) is taken as the value. Otherwise, the
  #     following argument is taken as the value (e.g. for `--abc foo`, the
  #     value is set to `"foo"`.) The following argument is treated as the
  #     value even if it looks like a flag (e.g. `--abc --def` causes the
  #     string `"--def"` to be taken as the value.)
  #  *  `--abc[=VAL]` : A long flag that takes an optional value. If this
  #     argument appears with a value attached (e.g. `--abc=foo`), the
  #     attached string (e.g. `"foo"`) is taken as the value. Otherwise,
  #     the value is set to `true`. The following argument is never
  #     interpreted as the value. (Compare with `--abc [VAL]`.)
  #  *  `--abc [VAL]` : A long flag that takes an optional value. If this
  #     argument appears with a value attached (e.g. `--abc=foo`), the
  #     attached string (e.g. `"foo"`) is taken as the value. Otherwise, if
  #     the following argument does not look like a flag (i.e. it does not
  #     begin with a hyphen), it is taken as the value. (e.g. `--abc foo`
  #     causes the string `"foo"` to be taken as the value.). If there is
  #     no following argument, or the following argument looks like a flag,
  #     the value is set to `true`. (Compare with `--abc=[VAL]`.)
  #  *  `--[no-]abc` : A long boolean switch that can be turned either on
  #     or off. This effectively creates two flags, `--abc` which sets the
  #     value to `true`, and `--no-abc` which sets the falue to `false`.
  #
  # ### Default flag syntax
  #
  # If no flag syntax strings are provided, a default syntax will be
  # inferred based on the key and other options.
  #
  # Specifically, if the key has one character, then that character will be
  # chosen as a short flag. If the key has multiple characters, a long flag
  # will be generated.
  #
  # Furthermore, if a custom completion, a non-boolean acceptor, or a
  # non-boolean default value is provided in the options, then the flag
  # will be considered to take a value. Otherwise, it will be considered to
  # be a boolean switch.
  #
  # For example, the following pairs of flags are identical:
  #
  #     flag :a
  #     flag :a, "-a"
  #
  #     flag :abc_def
  #     flag :abc_def, "--abc-def"
  #
  #     flag :number, accept: Integer
  #     flag :number, "--number=VAL", accept: Integer
  #
  # ### More examples
  #
  # A flag that sets its value to the number of times it appears on the
  # command line:
  #
  #     flag :verbose, "-v", "--verbose",
  #          default: 0, handler: ->(_val, count) { count + 1 }
  #
  # An example using block form:
  #
  #     flag :shout do
  #       flags "-s", "--shout"
  #       default false
  #       desc "Say it louder"
  #       long_desc "This flag says it lowder.",
  #                 "You might use this when people can't hear you.",
  #                 "",
  #                 "Example:",
  #                 ["    toys say --shout hello"]
  #     end
  #
  # @param accept [Object] An acceptor that validates and/or converts the
  #   value. You may provide either the name of an acceptor you have
  #   defined, or one of the default acceptors provided by OptionParser.
  #   Optional. If not specified, accepts any value as a string.
  # @param add_method [true, false, nil] Whether to add a method for this
  #   flag. If omitted or set to nil, uses the default behavior, which
  #   adds the method if the key is a symbol representing a legal method
  #   name that starts with a letter and does not override any public
  #   method in the Ruby Object class or collide with any method directly
  #   defined in the tool class.
  # @param block [Proc] Configures the flag. See {Toys::DSL::Flag} for the
  #   directives that can be called in this block.
  # @param complete_flags [Object] A specifier for shell tab completion
  #   for flag names associated with this flag. By default, a
  #   {Toys::Flag::DefaultCompletion} is used, which provides the flag's
  #   names as completion candidates. To customize completion, set this
  #   to the name of a previously defined completion, a hash of options
  #   to pass to the constructor for {Toys::Flag::DefaultCompletion}, or
  #   any other spec recognized by {Toys::Completion.create}.
  # @param complete_values [Object] A specifier for shell tab completion
  #   for flag values associated with this flag. This is the empty
  #   completion by default. To customize completion, set this to the
  #   name of a previously defined completion, or any spec recognized by
  #   {Toys::Completion.create}.
  # @param default [Object] The default value. This is the value that will
  #   be set in the context if this flag is not provided on the command
  #   line. Defaults to `nil`.
  # @param desc [String, Array<String>, Toys::WrappableString] Short
  #   description for the flag. See {Toys::DSL::Tool#desc} for a
  #   description of the allowed formats. Defaults to the empty string.
  # @param display_name [String] A display name for this flag, used in help
  #   text and error messages.
  # @param flags [String...] The flags in OptionParser format.
  # @param handler [Proc, nil, :set, :push] An optional handler for
  #   setting/updating the value. A handler is a proc taking two
  #   arguments, the given value and the previous value, returning the
  #   new value that should be set. You may also specify a predefined
  #   named handler. The `:set` handler (the default) replaces the
  #   previous value (effectively `-> (val, _prev) { val }`). The
  #   `:push` handler expects the previous value to be an array and
  #   pushes the given value onto it; it should be combined with setting
  #   `default: []` and is intended for "multi-valued" flags.
  # @param key [String, Symbol] The key to use to retrieve the value from
  #   the execution context.
  # @param long_desc [Array<String,Array<String>,Toys::WrappableString>] Long description for the flag. See {Toys::DSL::Tool#long_desc} for
  #   a description of the allowed formats. (But note that this param
  #   takes an Array of description lines, rather than a series of
  #   arguments.) Defaults to the empty array.
  # @param report_collisions [Boolean] Raise an exception if a flag is
  #   requested that is already in use or marked as unusable. Default is
  #   true.
  # @return [self]

  # directly to this method, or you may pass any input that can be used to
  # construct a wrappable string:
  #
  #  *  If you pass a String, its whitespace will be compacted (i.e. tabs,
  #     newlines, and multiple consecutive whitespace will be turned into a
  #     single space), and it will be word-wrapped on whitespace.
  #  *  If you pass an Array of Strings, each string will be considered a
  #     literal word that cannot be broken, and wrapping will be done
  #     across the strings in the array. In this case, whitespace is not
  #     compacted.
  #
  # ### Examples
  #
  # If you pass in a sentence as a simple string, it may be word wrapped
  # when displayed:
  #
  #     desc "This sentence may be wrapped."
  #
  # To specify a sentence that should never be word-wrapped, pass it as the
  # sole element of a string array:

  #     desc ["This sentence will not be wrapped."]

  # @return [self]

  def display_name(display_name); end

  # Add to the long description for the current positional argument. The
  # long description is displayed with the argument in online help. This
  # directive may be given multiple times, and the results are cumulative.
  #
  # A long description is a series of descriptions, which are generally
  # displayed in a series of lines/paragraphs. Each individual description
  # uses the form described in the {#desc} documentation, and may be
  # word-wrapped when displayed. To insert a blank line, include an empty
  # string as one of the descriptions.
  #
  # ### Example
  #
  #     long_desc "This initial paragraph might get word wrapped.",
  #               "This next paragraph is followed by a blank line.",
  #               "",
  #               ["This line will not be wrapped."],
  #               ["    This indent is preserved."]
  #     long_desc "This line is appended to the description."
  #
  # @param long_desc [String, Array<String>, Toys::WrappableString...]

# This module defines the DSL for a Toys configuration file.
#
# A Toys configuration defines one or more named tools. It provides syntax
# for setting the description, defining flags and arguments, specifying
# how to execute the tool, and requesting mixin modules and other services.
# It also lets you define subtools, nested arbitrarily deep, using blocks.
#
# ### Simple example
#
# Create a file called `.toys.rb` in the current directory, with the
# following contents:
#
#     tool "greet" do
#       desc "Prints a simple greeting"
#
#       optional_arg :recipient, default: "world"
#
#       def run
#         puts "Hello, #{recipient}!"
#       end
#     end
#
# The DSL directives `tool`, `desc`, `optional_arg`, and others are defined
# in this module.
#
# Now you can execute it using:
#
#     toys greet
#
# or try:
#
#     toys greet rubyists
#
# source://toys-core//lib/toys/dsl/tool.rb#39
module Toys::DSL::Tool
  # Create a named acceptor that can be referenced by name from any flag or
  # positional argument in this tool or its subtools.
  #
  # An acceptor validates the string parameter passed to a flag or
  # positional argument. It also optionally converts the string to a
  # different object before storing it in your tool's data.
  #
  # Acceptors can be defined in one of four ways.
  #
  #  *  You can provide a **regular expression**. This acceptor validates
  #     only if the regex matches the *entire string parameter*.
  #
  #     You can also provide an optional conversion function as a block. If
  #     provided, function must take a variable number of arguments, the
  #     first being the matched string and the remainder being the captures
  #     from the regular expression. It should return the converted object
  #     that will be stored in the context data. If you do not provide a
  #     block, the original string will be used.
  #
  #  *  You can provide an **array** of possible values. The acceptor
  #     validates if the string parameter matches the *string form* of one
  #     of the array elements (i.e. the results of calling `to_s` on the
  #     array elements.)
  #
  #     An array acceptor automatically converts the string parameter to
  #     the actual array element that it matched. For example, if the
  #     symbol `:foo` is in the array, it will match the string `"foo"`,
  #     and then store the symbol `:foo` in the tool data.
  #
  #  *  You can provide a **range** of possible values, along with a
  #     conversion function that converts a string parameter to a type
  #     comparable by the range. (See the "function" spec below for a
  #     detailed description of conversion functions.) If the range has
  #     numeric endpoints, the conversion function is optional because a
  #     default will be provided.
  #
  #  *  You can provide a **function** by passing it as a proc or a block.
  #     This function performs *both* validation and conversion. It should
  #     take the string parameter as its argument, and it must either
  #     return the object that should be stored in the tool data, or raise
  #     an exception (descended from `StandardError`) to indicate that the
  #     string parameter is invalid.
  #
  # ### Example
  #
  # The following example creates an acceptor named "hex" that is defined
  # via a regular expression. It uses the acceptor to validate values
  # passed to a flag.
  #
  #     tool "example" do
  #       acceptor "hex", /[0-9a-fA-F]+/, type_desc: "hex numbers"
  #       flag :number, accept: "hex"
  #       def run
  #         puts "number was #{number}"
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  # @param block [Proc] See the description for recognized forms.
  # @param name [String] The acceptor name.
  # @param spec [Object] See the description for recognized values.
  # @param type_desc [String] Type description string, shown in help.
  #   Defaults to the acceptor name.
  # @return [self]
  #
  # source://toys-core//lib/toys/dsl/tool.rb#105
  def acceptor(name, spec = T.unsafe(nil), type_desc: T.unsafe(nil), &block); end

  # Create an alias, representing an "alternate name" for a tool.
  #
  # Note: This is functionally equivalent to creating a tool with the
  # `:delegate_relative` option. As such, `alias_tool` is considered
  # deprecated.
  #
  # ### Example
  #
  # This example defines a tool and an alias pointing to it. Both the tool
  # name `test` and the alias `t` will then refer to the same tool.
  #
  #     tool "test" do
  #       def run
  #         puts "Running tests..."
  #       end
  #     end
  #     alias_tool "t", "test"
  #     # Note: the following is preferred over alias_tool:
  #     # tool "t", delegate_relative: "test"
  #
  # @deprecated Use {#tool} and pass `:delegate_relative` instead
  # @param target [String, Array<String>] Relative path to the target of the
  #   alias. This path may be given as an array of strings, or a single
  #   string possibly delimited by path separators.
  # @param word [String] The name of the alias
  # @return [self]
  #
  # source://toys-core//lib/toys/dsl/tool.rb#368

  # Set the shell completion strategy for this tool's arguments.
  # You can pass one of the following:
  #
  #  *  The string name of a completion defined in this tool or any of its
  #     its ancestors.
  #  *  A hash of options to pass to the constructor of

  #     (which is {Toys::ToolDefinition::DefaultCompletion} with no extra
  #     options).
  #  *  Any other specification recognized by {Toys::Completion.create}.
  #
  # ### Example
  #
  # The namespace "foo" supports completion only of subtool names. It does
  # not complete the standard flags (like --help).
  #
  #     tool "foo" do

  # Create a named completion procedure that may be used by name by any
  # flag or positional arg in this tool or any subtool.
  #
  # A completion controls tab completion for the value of a flag or
  # positional argument. In general, it is a Ruby `Proc` that takes a
  # context object (of type {Toys::Completion::Context}) and returns an
  # array of completion candidate strings.
  #
  # Completions can be specified in one of three ways.
  #
  #  *  A Proc object itself, either passed directly to this directive or
  #     provided as a block.
  #  *  A static array of strings, indicating the completion candidates
  #     independent of context.
  #  *  The symbol `:file_system` which indicates that paths in the file
  #     system should serve as completion candidates.
  #
  # ### Example
  #
  # The following example defines a completion that uses only the immediate
  # files in the current directory as candidates. (This is different from
  # the `:file_system` completion which will descend into subdirectories
  # similar to how bash completes most of its file system commands.)
  #
  #     completion "local-files" do |_context|
  #       `/bin/ls`.split("\n")
  #     end
  #     tool "example" do
  #       flag :file, complete_values: "local-files"
  #       def run
  #         puts "selected file #{file}"
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  # @param block [Proc] See the description for recognized forms.

  def current_tool; end

  # Causes the current tool to delegate to another tool, specified by the
  # full tool name. When run, it simply invokes the target tool with the

  #
  # ### Example
  #
  # This example defines a tool that runs one of its subtools. Running the
  # `test` tool will have the same effect (and recognize the same args) as
  # the subtool `test unit`.
  #
  #     tool "test" do
  #       tool "unit" do
  #         flag :faster

  # Set the short description for the current tool. The short description
  # is displayed with the tool in a subtool list. You may also use the
  # equivalent method `short_desc`.
  #
  # The description is a {Toys::WrappableString}, which may be word-wrapped
  # when displayed in a help screen. You may pass a {Toys::WrappableString}
  # directly to this method, or you may pass any input that can be used to
  # construct a wrappable string:
  #
  #  *  If you pass a String, its whitespace will be compacted (i.e. tabs,
  #     newlines, and multiple consecutive whitespace will be turned into a
  #     single space), and it will be word-wrapped on whitespace.
  #  *  If you pass an Array of Strings, each string will be considered a
  #     literal word that cannot be broken, and wrapping will be done
  #     across the strings in the array. In this case, whitespace is not
  #     compacted.
  #
  # ### Examples
  #
  # If you pass in a sentence as a simple string, it may be word wrapped
  # when displayed:
  #
  #     desc "This sentence may be wrapped."
  #
  # To specify a sentence that should never be word-wrapped, pass it as the
  # sole element of a string array:
  #
  #     desc ["This sentence will not be wrapped."]

  # full unparsed argument list by calling {Toys::Context#args}.
  #
  # This directive is mutually exclusive with any of the directives that
  # declare arguments or flags.
  #
  # ### Example
  #

  def disable_argument_parsing; end

  # Mark one or more flags as disabled, preventing their use by any
  # subsequent flag definition. This can be used to prevent middleware from
  # defining a particular flag.
  #
  # ### Example
  #
  # This tool does not support the `-v` and `-q` short forms for the two
  # verbosity flags (although it still supports the long forms `--verbose`
  # and `--quiet`.)
  #

  # Expand the given template in the current location.
  #

  # Find the given data path (file or directory).
  #
  # Data directories are a convenient place to put images, archives, keys,
  # or other such static data needed by your tools. Data files are located
  # in a directory called `.data` inside a Toys directory. This directive
  # locates a data file during tool definition.
  #
  # ### Example
  #
  # This tool reads its description from a text file in the `.data`
  # directory.
  #
  #     tool "mytool" do
  #       path = find_data("mytool-desc.txt", type: :file)
  #       desc IO.read(path) if path
  #       def run
  #         # ...
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  # @param path [String] The path to find
  # @param type [nil, :file, :directory] Type of file system object to find.
  #   Default is `nil`, indicating any type.
  # @return [String] Absolute path of the data.
  # @return [nil] if the given data path is not found.
  #
  # source://toys-core//lib/toys/dsl/tool.rb#1690
  def find_data(path, type: T.unsafe(nil)); end

  # Add a flag to the current tool. Each flag must specify a key which
  # the script may use to obtain the flag value from the context.
  # You may then provide the flags themselves in OptionParser form.
  #
  # If the given key is a symbol representing a valid method name, then a
  # helper method is automatically added to retrieve the value. Otherwise,
  # if the key is a string or does not represent a valid method name, the
  # tool can retrieve the value by calling {Toys::Context#get}.
  #
  # Attributes of the flag may be passed in as arguments to this method, or
  # set in a block passed to this method. If you provide a block, you can
  # use directives in {Toys::DSL::Flag} within the block.
  #
  # ### Flag syntax
  #
  # The flags themselves should be provided in OptionParser form. Following
  # are examples of valid syntax.
  #
  #  *  `-a` : A short boolean switch. When this appears as an argument,
  #     the value is set to `true`.
  #  *  `--abc` : A long boolean switch. When this appears as an argument,
  #     the value is set to `true`.
  #  *  `-aVAL` or `-a VAL` : A short flag that takes a required value.
  #     These two forms are treated identically. If this argument appears
  #     with a value attached (e.g. `-afoo`), the attached string (e.g.
  #     `"foo"`) is taken as the value. Otherwise, the following argument
  #     is taken as the value (e.g. for `-a foo`, the value is set to
  #     `"foo"`.) The following argument is treated as the value even if it
  #     looks like a flag (e.g. `-a -a` causes the string `"-a"` to be
  #     taken as the value.)
  #  *  `-a[VAL]` : A short flag that takes an optional value. If this
  #     argument appears with a value attached (e.g. `-afoo`), the attached
  #     string (e.g. `"foo"`) is taken as the value. Otherwise, the value
  #     is set to `true`. The following argument is never interpreted as
  #     the value. (Compare with `-a [VAL]`.)
  #  *  `-a [VAL]` : A short flag that takes an optional value. If this
  #     argument appears with a value attached (e.g. `-afoo`), the attached
  #     string (e.g. `"foo"`) is taken as the value. Otherwise, if the
  #     following argument does not look like a flag (i.e. it does not
  #     begin with a hyphen), it is taken as the value. (e.g. `-a foo`
  #     causes the string `"foo"` to be taken as the value.). If there is
  #     no following argument, or the following argument looks like a flag,
  #     the value is set to `true`. (Compare with `-a[VAL]`.)
  #  *  `--abc=VAL` or `--abc VAL` : A long flag that takes a required
  #     value. These two forms are treated identically. If this argument
  #     appears with a value attached (e.g. `--abc=foo`), the attached
  #     string (e.g. `"foo"`) is taken as the value. Otherwise, the
  #     following argument is taken as the value (e.g. for `--abc foo`, the
  #     value is set to `"foo"`.) The following argument is treated as the
  #     value even if it looks like a flag (e.g. `--abc --def` causes the
  #     string `"--def"` to be taken as the value.)
  #  *  `--abc[=VAL]` : A long flag that takes an optional value. If this
  #     argument appears with a value attached (e.g. `--abc=foo`), the
  #     attached string (e.g. `"foo"`) is taken as the value. Otherwise,
  #     the value is set to `true`. The following argument is never
  #     interpreted as the value. (Compare with `--abc [VAL]`.)
  #  *  `--abc [VAL]` : A long flag that takes an optional value. If this
  #     argument appears with a value attached (e.g. `--abc=foo`), the
  #     attached string (e.g. `"foo"`) is taken as the value. Otherwise, if
  #     the following argument does not look like a flag (i.e. it does not
  #     begin with a hyphen), it is taken as the value. (e.g. `--abc foo`
  #     causes the string `"foo"` to be taken as the value.). If there is
  #     no following argument, or the following argument looks like a flag,
  #     the value is set to `true`. (Compare with `--abc=[VAL]`.)
  #  *  `--[no-]abc` : A long boolean switch that can be turned either on
  #     or off. This effectively creates two flags, `--abc` which sets the
  #     value to `true`, and `--no-abc` which sets the falue to `false`.
  #
  # ### Default flag syntax
  #
  # If no flag syntax strings are provided, a default syntax will be
  # inferred based on the key and other options.
  #
  # Specifically, if the key has one character, then that character will be
  # chosen as a short flag. If the key has multiple characters, a long flag
  # will be generated.
  #
  # Furthermore, if a custom completion, a non-boolean acceptor, or a
  # non-boolean default value is provided in the options, then the flag
  # will be considered to take a value. Otherwise, it will be considered to
  # be a boolean switch.
  #
  # For example, the following pairs of flags are identical:
  #
  #     flag :a
  #     flag :a, "-a"
  #
  #     flag :abc_def
  #     flag :abc_def, "--abc-def"
  #
  #     flag :number, accept: Integer
  #     flag :number, "--number=VAL", accept: Integer
  #
  # ### More examples
  #
  # A flag that sets its value to the number of times it appears on the
  # command line:
  #
  #     flag :verbose, "-v", "--verbose",
  #          default: 0, handler: ->(_val, count) { count + 1 }
  #
  # An example using block form:
  #
  #     flag :shout do
  #       flags "-s", "--shout"
  #       default false
  #       desc "Say it louder"
  #       long_desc "This flag says it lowder.",
  #                 "You might use this when people can't hear you.",
  #                 "",
  #                 "Example:",
  #                 ["    toys say --shout hello"]
  #     end
  #
  # @param accept [Object] An acceptor that validates and/or converts the
  #   value. You may provide either the name of an acceptor you have
  #   defined, one of the default acceptors provided by OptionParser, or
  #   any other specification recognized by {Toys::Acceptor.create}.
  #   Optional. If not specified, accepts any value as a string.
  # @param add_method [true, false, nil] Whether to add a method for this
  #   flag. If omitted or set to nil, uses the default behavior, which
  #   adds the method if the key is a symbol representing a legal method
  #   name that starts with a letter and does not override any public
  #   method in the Ruby Object class or collide with any method directly
  #   defined in the tool class.
  # @param block [Proc] Configures the flag. See {Toys::DSL::Flag} for the
  #   directives that can be called in this block.
  # @param complete_flags [Object] A specifier for shell tab completion
  #   for flag names associated with this flag. By default, a
  #   {Toys::Flag::DefaultCompletion} is used, which provides the flag's
  #   names as completion candidates. To customize completion, set this
  #   to the name of a previously defined completion, a hash of options
  #   to pass to the constructor for {Toys::Flag::DefaultCompletion}, or
  #   any other spec recognized by {Toys::Completion.create}.
  # @param complete_values [Object] A specifier for shell tab completion
  #   for flag values associated with this flag. This is the empty
  #   completion by default. To customize completion, set this to the
  #   name of a previously defined completion, or any spec recognized by
  #   {Toys::Completion.create}.
  # @param default [Object] The default value. This is the value that will
  #   be set in the context if this flag is not provided on the command
  #   line. Defaults to `nil`.
  # @param desc [String, Array<String>, Toys::WrappableString] Short
  #   description for the flag. See {Toys::DSL::Tool#desc} for a
  #   description of the allowed formats. Defaults to the empty string.
  # @param display_name [String] A display name for this flag, used in help
  #   text and error messages.
  # @param flags [String...] The flags in OptionParser format.
  # @param group [Toys::FlagGroup, String, Symbol, nil] Group for this flag.
  #   You may provide a group name, a FlagGroup object, or `nil` which
  #   denotes the default group.
  # @param handler [Proc, nil, :set, :push] An optional handler for
  #   setting/updating the value. A handler is a proc taking two
  #   arguments, the given value and the previous value, returning the
  #   new value that should be set. You may also specify a predefined
  #   named handler. The `:set` handler (the default) replaces the
  #   previous value (effectively `-> (val, _prev) { val }`). The
  #   `:push` handler expects the previous value to be an array and
  #   pushes the given value onto it; it should be combined with setting
  #   `default: []` and is intended for "multi-valued" flags.
  # @param key [String, Symbol] The key to use to retrieve the value from
  #   the execution context.
  # @param long_desc [Array<String,Array<String>,Toys::WrappableString>] Long description for the flag. See {Toys::DSL::Tool#long_desc} for
  #   a description of the allowed formats. (But note that this param
  #   takes an Array of description lines, rather than a series of
  #   arguments.) Defaults to the empty array.
  # @param report_collisions [Boolean] Raise an exception if a flag is
  #   requested that is already in use or marked as unusable. Default is
  #   true.
  # @return [self]

  # Add to the long description for the current tool. The long description
  # is displayed in the usage documentation for the tool itself. This
  # directive may be given multiple times, and the results are cumulative.
  #
  # A long description is a series of descriptions, which are generally
  # displayed in a series of lines/paragraphs. Each individual description
  # uses the form described in the {#desc} documentation, and may be
  # word-wrapped when displayed. To insert a blank line, include an empty
  # string as one of the descriptions.
  #
  # ### Example
  #
  #     long_desc "This initial paragraph might get word wrapped.",
  #               "This next paragraph is followed by a blank line.",
  #               "",
  #               ["This line will not be wrapped."],
  #               ["    This indent is preserved."]
  #     long_desc "This line is appended to the description."
  #
  # @param data [String] Optional. Read the description from the given data
  #   file. The file must be a plain text file whose suffix is `.txt`.
  # @param file [String] Optional. Read the description from the given file
  #   provided relative to the current toys file. The file must be a
  #   plain text file whose suffix is `.txt`.
  # @param strs [Toys::WrappableString, String, Array<String>...]

  # Create a named mixin module that can be included by name from this tool
  # or its subtools.
  #
  # A mixin is a module that defines methods that can be called from a
  # tool. It is commonly used to provide "utility" methods, implementing
  # common functionality and allowing tools to share code.
  #
  # Normally you provide a block and define the mixin's methods in that
  # block. Alternatively, you can create a module separately and pass it
  # directly to this directive.
  #
  # ### Example
  #
  # The following example creates a named mixin and uses it in a tool.
  #
  #     mixin "error-reporter" do
  #       def error message
  #         logger.error "An error occurred: #{message}"
  #         exit 1
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  #     tool "build" do
  #       include "error-reporter"
  #       def run
  #         puts "Building..."
  #         error "Build failed!"
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  # @param block [Proc] Defines the mixin module.
  # @param mixin_module [Module] Module to use as the mixin. Optional.
  #   Either pass a module here, *or* provide a block and define the
  #   mixin within the block.
  # @param name [String] Name of the mixin
  # @return [self]
  #
  # source://toys-core//lib/toys/dsl/tool.rb#149
  def mixin(name, mixin_module = T.unsafe(nil), &block); end

  # Specify how to handle interrupts.
  #
  # You can provide either a block to be called, a Proc to be called, or
  # the name of a method to be called. In each case, the block, Proc, or
  # method can optionally take one argument, the Interrupt exception that
  # was raised.
  #
  # Note: this is equivalent to `on_signal("SIGINT")`.
  #
  # ### Example
  #
  #     tool "foo" do
  #       def run
  #         sleep 10
  #       end
  #       on_interrupt do
  #         puts "I was interrupted."
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  # @param block [Proc] The interrupt callback as a block.
  # @param handler [Proc, Symbol, nil] The interrupt callback proc or method
  #   name. Pass nil to disable interrupt handling.
  # @return [self]
  #
  # source://toys-core//lib/toys/dsl/tool.rb#1531
  def on_interrupt(handler = T.unsafe(nil), &block); end

  # Specify how to run this tool.
  #
  # Typically the entrypoint for a tool is a method named `run`. However,
  # you can change this by passing a different method name, as a symbol, to
  # {#to_run}.
  #
  # You can also alternatively pass a block to {#to_run}. You might do this
  # if your method needs access to local variables in the lexical scope.
  # However, it is often more convenient to use {#static} to set those
  # values in the context.
  #
  # ### Examples
  #
  #     # Set a different method name as the entrypoint:
  #
  #     tool "foo" do
  #       to_run :foo
  #       def foo
  #         puts "The foo tool ran!"
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  #     # Use a block to retain access to the enclosing lexical scope from
  #     # the run method:
  #
  #     tool "foo" do
  #       cur_time = Time.now
  #       to_run do
  #         puts "The time at tool definition was #{cur_time}"
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  #     # But the following is approximately equivalent:
  #
  #     tool "foo" do
  #       static :cur_time, Time.now
  #       def run
  #         puts "The time at tool definition was #{cur_time}"
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  # @param block [Proc] The run handler as a block.
  # @param handler [Proc, Symbol, nil] The run handler as a method name
  #   symbol or a proc, or nil to explicitly set as non-runnable.
  # @return [self]
  #
  # source://toys-core//lib/toys/dsl/tool.rb#1503
  def on_run(handler = T.unsafe(nil), &block); end

  # Specify how to handle the given signal.
  #
  # You can provide either a block to be called, a Proc to be called, or
  # the name of a method to be called. In each case, the block, Proc, or
  # method can optionally take one argument, the SignalException that was
  # raised.
  #
  # ### Example
  #
  #     tool "foo" do
  #       def run
  #         sleep 10
  #       end
  #       on_signal("QUIT") do |e|
  #         puts "Signal caught: #{e.signm}."
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  # @param block [Proc] The signal callback as a block.
  # @param handler [Proc, Symbol, nil] The signal callback proc or method
  #   name. Pass nil to disable signal handling.
  # @param signal [Integer, String, Symbol] The signal name or number
  # @return [self]
  #
  # source://toys-core//lib/toys/dsl/tool.rb#1562
  def on_signal(signal, handler = T.unsafe(nil), &block); end

  # Specify how to handle usage errors.
  #
  # You can provide either a block to be called, a Proc to be called, or
  # the name of a method to be called. In each case, the block, Proc, or
  # method can optionally take one argument, the array of usage errors
  # reported.
  #
  # ### Example
  #
  # This tool runs even if a usage error is encountered, by setting the
  # `run` method as the usage error handler.
  #
  #     tool "foo" do
  #       def run
  #         puts "Errors: #{usage_errors.join("\n")}"
  #       end
  #       on_usage_error :run
  #     end
  #
  # @param block [Proc] The interrupt callback as a block.
  # @param handler [Proc, Symbol, nil] The interrupt callback proc or method
  #   name. Pass nil to disable interrupt handling.
  # @return [self]
  #
  # source://toys-core//lib/toys/dsl/tool.rb#1593
  def on_usage_error(handler = T.unsafe(nil), &block); end

  # Add an optional positional argument to the current tool. You must
  # specify a key which the script may use to obtain the argument value
  # from the context. If an optional argument is not given on the command
  # line, the value is set to the given default.
  #
  # If the given key is a symbol representing a valid method name, then a
  # helper method is automatically added to retrieve the value. Otherwise,
  # if the key is a string or does not represent a valid method name, the
  # tool can retrieve the value by calling {Toys::Context#get}.
  #
  # Attributes of the arg may be passed in as arguments to this method, or
  # set in a block passed to this method. If you provide a block, you can
  # use directives in {Toys::DSL::PositionalArg} within the block.
  #
  # ### Example
  #
  # This tool creates a "link" to a given target. The link location is
  # optional; if it is not given, it is inferred from the target.
  #
  #     tool "ln" do
  #       required_arg :target
  #       optional_arg :location
  #       def run
  #         loc = location || File.basename(target)
  #         puts "linking to #{target} from #{loc}..."
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  # @param accept [Object] An acceptor that validates and/or converts the
  #   value. You may provide either the name of an acceptor you have
  #   defined, one of the default acceptors provided by OptionParser, or
  #   any other specification recognized by {Toys::Acceptor.create}.
  #   Optional. If not specified, accepts any value as a string.
  # @param add_method [true, false, nil] Whether to add a method for this
  #   argument. If omitted or set to nil, uses the default behavior,
  #   which adds the method if the key is a symbol representing a legal
  #   method name that starts with a letter and does not override any
  #   public method in the Ruby Object class or collide with any method
  #   directly defined in the tool class.
  # @param block [Proc] Configures the positional argument. See
  #   {Toys::DSL::PositionalArg} for the directives that can be called in
  #   this block.
  # @param complete [Object] A specifier for shell tab completion for
  #   values of this arg. This is the empty completion by default. To
  #   customize completion, set this to the name of a previously defined
  #   completion, or any spec recognized by {Toys::Completion.create}.
  # @param default [Object] The default value. This is the value that will
  #   be set in the context if this argument is not provided on the

  # @param desc [String, Array<String>, Toys::WrappableString] Short
  #   description for the flag. See {Toys::DSL::Tool#desc} for a
  #   description of the allowed formats. Defaults to the empty string.

  # Add a required positional argument to the current tool. You must
  # specify a key which the script may use to obtain the argument value
  # from the context.
  #
  # If the given key is a symbol representing a valid method name, then a
  # helper method is automatically added to retrieve the value. Otherwise,
  # if the key is a string or does not represent a valid method name, the
  # tool can retrieve the value by calling {Toys::Context#get}.
  #
  # Attributes of the arg may be passed in as arguments to this method, or
  # set in a block passed to this method. If you provide a block, you can
  # use directives in {Toys::DSL::PositionalArg} within the block.
  #
  # ### Example
  #
  # This tool "moves" something from a source to destination, and takes two
  # required arguments:
  #
  #     tool "mv" do
  #       required_arg :source
  #       required_arg :dest
  #       def run
  #         puts "moving from #{source} to #{dest}..."

  #   value. You may provide either the name of an acceptor you have
  #   defined, one of the default acceptors provided by OptionParser, or
  #   any other specification recognized by {Toys::Acceptor.create}.
  #   Optional. If not specified, accepts any value as a string.
  # @param add_method [true, false, nil] Whether to add a method for this
  #   argument. If omitted or set to nil, uses the default behavior,
  #   which adds the method if the key is a symbol representing a legal
  #   method name that starts with a letter and does not override any
  #   public method in the Ruby Object class or collide with any method
  #   directly defined in the tool class.
  # @param block [Proc] Configures the positional argument. See
  #   {Toys::DSL::PositionalArg} for the directives that can be called in
  #   this block.
  # @param complete [Object] A specifier for shell tab completion for
  #   values of this arg. This is the empty completion by default. To
  #   customize completion, set this to the name of a previously defined
  #   completion, or any spec recognized by {Toys::Completion.create}.
  # @param desc [String, Array<String>, Toys::WrappableString] Short
  #   description for the flag. See {Toys::DSL::Tool#desc} for a
  #   description of the allowed formats. Defaults to the empty string.
  # @param display_name [String] A name to use for display (in help text
  #   and error reports). Defaults to the key in upper case.
  # @param key [String, Symbol] The key to use to retrieve the value from
  #   the execution context.
  # @param long_desc [Array<String,Array<String>,Toys::WrappableString>] Long description for the flag. See {Toys::DSL::Tool#long_desc} for

  # Set the short description for the current tool. The short description
  # is displayed with the tool in a subtool list. You may also use the
  # equivalent method `short_desc`.
  #
  # The description is a {Toys::WrappableString}, which may be word-wrapped
  # when displayed in a help screen. You may pass a {Toys::WrappableString}
  # directly to this method, or you may pass any input that can be used to
  # construct a wrappable string:
  #
  #  *  If you pass a String, its whitespace will be compacted (i.e. tabs,
  #     newlines, and multiple consecutive whitespace will be turned into a
  #     single space), and it will be word-wrapped on whitespace.
  #  *  If you pass an Array of Strings, each string will be considered a
  #     literal word that cannot be broken, and wrapping will be done
  #     across the strings in the array. In this case, whitespace is not
  #     compacted.
  #
  # ### Examples
  #
  # If you pass in a sentence as a simple string, it may be word wrapped
  # when displayed:
  #
  #     desc "This sentence may be wrapped."
  #
  # To specify a sentence that should never be word-wrapped, pass it as the
  # sole element of a string array:
  #
  #     desc ["This sentence will not be wrapped."]
  #
  # @param str [Toys::WrappableString, String, Array<String>]
  # @return [self]

  #
  # If any given key is a symbol representing a valid method name, then a
  # helper method is automatically added to retrieve the value. Otherwise,
  # if the key is a string or does not represent a valid method name, the
  # tool can retrieve the value by calling {Toys::Context#get}.
  #
  # ### Example
  #
  #     tool "hello" do
  #       static :greeting, "Hi there"
  #       def run
  #         puts "#{greeting}, world!"

  # Applies the given block to all subtools, recursively. Effectively, the
  # given block is run at the *end* of every tool block. This can be used,
  # for example, to provide some shared configuration for all tools.
  #
  # The block is applied only to subtools defined *after* the block
  # appears. Subtools defined before the block appears are not affected.
  #
  # ### Example
  #
  # It is common for tools to use the `:exec` mixin to invoke external
  # programs. This example automatically includes the exec mixin in all
  # subtools, recursively, so you do not have to repeat the `include`
  # directive in every tool.
  #
  #     # .toys.rb
  #
  #     subtool_apply do
  #       # Include the mixin only if the tool hasn't already done so
  #       unless include?(:exec)
  #         include :exec, exit_on_nonzero_status: true
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  #     tool "foo" do
  #       def run
  #         # This tool has access to methods defined by the :exec mixin
  #         # because the above block is applied to the tool.
  #         sh "echo hello"
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  # source://toys-core//lib/toys/dsl/tool.rb#1762
  def subtool_apply(&block); end

  # Create a named template that can be expanded by name from this tool
  # or its subtools.
  #
  # A template is an object that generates DSL directives. You can use it
  # to build "prefabricated" tools, and then instantiate them in your Toys
  # files.
  #
  # A template is an object that defines an `expansion` procedure. This
  # procedure generates the DSL directives implemented by the template. The
  # template object typically also includes attributes that are used to
  # configure the expansion.
  #
  # The simplest way to define a template is to pass a block to the
  # {#template} directive. In the block, define an `initialize` method that
  # accepts any arguments that may be passed to the template when it is
  # instantiated and are used to configure the template. Define
  # `attr_reader`s or other methods to make this configuration accessible
  # from the object. Then define an `on_expand` block that implements the
  # template's expansion. The template object is passed as an object to the
  # `on_expand` block.
  #
  # Alternately, you can create a template class separately and pass it
  # directly. See {Toys::Template} for details on creating a template
  # class.
  #
  # ### Example
  #
  # The following example creates and uses a simple template. The template
  # defines a tool, with a configurable name, that simply prints out a
  # configurable message.
  #
  #     template "hello-generator" do
  #       def initialize(name, message)
  #         @name = name
  #         @message = message
  #       end
  #       attr_reader :name, :message
  #       on_expand do |template|
  #         tool template.name do
  #           to_run do
  #             puts template.message
  #           end
  #         end
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  #     expand "hello-generator", "mytool", "mytool is running!"
  #
  # @param block [Proc] Defines the template class.
  # @param name [String] Name of the template
  # @param template_class [Class] Module to use as the mixin. Optional.
  #   Either pass a module here, *or* provide a block and define the
  #   mixin within the block.
  # @return [self]
  #
  # source://toys-core//lib/toys/dsl/tool.rb#211
  def template(name, template_class = T.unsafe(nil), &block); end

  # Specify how to run this tool.
  #
  # Typically the entrypoint for a tool is a method named `run`. However,
  # you can change this by passing a different method name, as a symbol, to
  # {#to_run}.
  #
  # You can also alternatively pass a block to {#to_run}. You might do this
  # if your method needs access to local variables in the lexical scope.
  # However, it is often more convenient to use {#static} to set those
  # values in the context.
  #
  # ### Examples
  #
  #     # Set a different method name as the entrypoint:
  #
  #     tool "foo" do
  #       to_run :foo
  #       def foo
  #         puts "The foo tool ran!"
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  #     # Use a block to retain access to the enclosing lexical scope from
  #     # the run method:
  #
  #     tool "foo" do
  #       cur_time = Time.now
  #       to_run do
  #         puts "The time at tool definition was #{cur_time}"
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  #     # But the following is approximately equivalent:
  #
  #     tool "foo" do
  #       static :cur_time, Time.now
  #       def run
  #         puts "The time at tool definition was #{cur_time}"
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  # @param block [Proc] The run handler as a block.
  # @param handler [Proc, Symbol, nil] The run handler as a method name
  #   symbol or a proc, or nil to explicitly set as non-runnable.
  # @return [self]
  #
  # source://toys-core//lib/toys/dsl/tool.rb#1498
  def to_run(handler = T.unsafe(nil), &block); end

  # Create a subtool. You must provide a block defining the subtool.
  #
  # ### Example
  #
  # The following example defines a tool and two subtools within it.
  #
  #     tool "build" do
  #       tool "staging" do
  #         def run
  #           puts "Building staging"
  #         end
  #       end
  #       tool "production" do
  #         def run
  #           puts "Building production"
  #         end
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  # The following example uses `delegate_to` to define a tool that runs one
  # of its subtools.
  #
  #     tool "test", delegate_to: ["test", "unit"] do
  #       tool "unit" do
  #         def run
  #           puts "Running unit tests"
  #         end
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  # @param block [Proc] Defines the subtool.
  # @param delegate_relative [String, Array<String>] Optional. Similar to
  #   delegate_to, but takes a delegate name relative to the context in
  #   which this tool is being defined.
  # @param delegate_to [String, Array<String>] Optional. This tool should
  #   delegate to another tool, specified by the full path. This path may
  #   be given as an array of strings, or a single string possibly
  #   delimited by path separators.
  # @param if_defined [:combine, :reset, :ignore] What to do if a definition
  #   already exists for this tool. Possible values are `:combine` (the
  #   default) indicating the definition should be combined with the
  #   existing definition, `:reset` indicating the earlier definition
  #   should be reset and the new definition applied instead, or
  #   `:ignore` indicating the new definition should be ignored.

# A middleware is an object that has the opportunity to alter the
# configuration and runtime behavior of each tool in a Toys CLI. A CLI
# contains an ordered list of middleware, known as the *middleware stack*,
# that together define the CLI's default behavior.
#
# Specifically, a middleware can perform two functions.
#
# First, it can modify the configuration of a tool. After tools are defined
# from configuration, the middleware stack can make modifications to each
# tool. A middleware can add flags and arguments to the tool, modify the
# description, or make any other changes to how the tool is set up.
#
# Second, a middleware can intercept and change tool execution. Like a Rack
# middleware, a Toys middleware can wrap execution with its own code,
# replace it outright, or leave it unmodified.
#
# Generally, a middleware is a class that implements one or more of the
# methods defined in this module: {Toys::Middleware#config}, and
# {Toys::Middleware#run}. This module provides default implementations that
# do nothing, but it is not required to include this module, or even to
# define both methods. Middleware objects need respond only to methods they
# care about.
#
# source://toys-core//lib/toys/middleware.rb#28
module Toys::Middleware
  # This method is called *after* a tool has been defined, and gives this
  # middleware the opportunity to modify the tool definition. It is passed
  # the tool definition object and the loader, and can make any changes to
  # the tool definition. In most cases, this method should also call
  # `yield`, which passes control to the next middleware in the stack. A
  # middleware can disable modifications done by subsequent middleware by
  # omitting the `yield` call, but this is uncommon.
  #
  # This basic implementation does nothing and simply yields to the next
  # middleware.
  #
  # @param loader [Toys::Loader] The loader that loaded this tool.
  # @param tool [Toys::ToolDefinition] The tool definition to modify.
  # @return [void]
  #
  # source://toys-core//lib/toys/middleware.rb#45
  def config(tool, loader); end

  # This method is called when the tool is run. It gives the middleware an
  # opportunity to modify the runtime behavior of the tool. It is passed
  # the tool instance (i.e. the object that hosts a tool's `run` method),
  # and you can use this object to access the tool's options and other
  # context data. In most cases, this method should also call `yield`,
  # which passes control to the next middleware in the stack. A middleware
  # can "wrap" normal execution by calling `yield` somewhere in its
  # implementation of this method, or it can completely replace the
  # execution behavior by not calling `yield` at all.
  #
  # Like a tool's `run` method, this method's return value is unused. If
  # you want to output from a tool, write to stdout or stderr. If you want
  # to set the exit status code, call {Toys::Context#exit} on the context.

# A mixin definition. Mixin modules should include this module.
#
# A mixin is a collection of methods that are available to be called from a
# tool implementation (i.e. its run method). The mixin is added to the tool
# class, so it has access to the same methods that can be called by the tool,
# such as {Toys::Context#get}.
#
# ### Usage
#
# To create a mixin, define a module, and include this module. Then define
# the methods you want to be available.
#
# If you want to perform some initialization specific to the mixin, you can
# provide an *initializer* block and/or an *inclusion* block. These can be
# specified by calling the module methods defined in
# {Toys::Mixin::ModuleMethods}.
#
# The initializer block is called when the tool context is instantiated
# in preparation for execution. It has access to context methods such as
# {Toys::Context#get}, and can perform setup for the tool execution itself,
# such as initializing some persistent state and storing it in the tool using
# {Toys::Context#set}. The initializer block is passed any extra arguments
# that were provided to the `include` directive. Define the initializer by
# calling {Toys::Mixin::ModuleMethods#on_initialize}.
#
# The inclusion block is called in the context of your tool class when your
# mixin is included. It is also passed any extra arguments that were provided
# to the `include` directive. It can be used to issue directives to define
# tools or other objects in the DSL, or even enhance the DSL by defining DSL
# methods specific to the mixin. Define the inclusion block by calling
# {Toys::Mixin::ModuleMethods#on_include}.
#
# ### Example
#
# This is an example that implements a simple counter. Whenever the counter
# is incremented, a log message is emitted. The tool can also retrieve the
# final counter value.
#
#     # Define a mixin by creating a module that includes Toys::Mixin
#     module MyCounterMixin
#       include Toys::Mixin
#
#       # Initialize the counter. Notice that the initializer is evaluated
#       # in the context of the runtime context, so has access to the runtime
#       # context state.
#       on_initialize do |start = 0|
#         set(:counter_value, start)
#       end
#
#       # Mixin methods are evaluated in the runtime context and so have
#       # access to the runtime context state, just as if you had defined
#       # them in your tool.
#       def counter_value
#         get(:counter_value)
#       end
#
#       def increment
#         set(:counter_value, counter_value + 1)

# A settings class defines the structure of application settings, i.e. the
# various fields that can be set, and their types. You can define a settings
# structure by subclassing this base class, and using the provided methods.
#
# ### Attributes
#
# To define an attribute, use the {Settings.settings_attr} declaration.
#
# Example:
#
#     class ServiceSettings < Toys::Settings
#       settings_attr :endpoint, default: "api.example.com"
#     end
#
#     my_settings = ServiceSettings.new
#     my_settings.endpoint_set?   # => false
#     my_settings.endpoint        # => "api.example.com"
#     my_settings.endpoint = "rest.example.com"
#     my_settings.endpoint_set?   # => true
#     my_settings.endpoint        # => "rest.example.com"
#     my_settings.endpoint_unset!
#     my_settings.endpoint_set?   # => false
#     my_settings.endpoint        # => "api.example.com"
#
# An attribute has a name, a default value, and a type specification. The
# name is used to define methods for getting and setting the attribute. The
# default is returned if no value is set. (See the section below on parents
# and defaults for more information.) The type specification governs what
# values are allowed. (See the section below on type specifications.)
#
# Attribute names must start with an ascii letter, and may contain only ascii
# letters, digits, and underscores. Unlike method names, they may not include
# non-ascii unicode characters, nor may they end with `!` or `?`.
# Additionally, the name `method_missing` is not allowed because of its
# special behavior in Ruby.
#
# Each attribute defines four methods: a getter, a setter, an unsetter, and a
# set detector. In the above example, the attribute named `:endpoint` creates
# the following four methods:
#
#  *  `endpoint` - retrieves the attribute value, or a default if not set.
#  *  `endpoint=(value)` - sets a new attribute value.
#  *  `endpoint_unset!` - unsets the attribute, reverting to a default.
#  *  `endpoint_set?` - returns a boolean, whether the attribute is set.
#
# ### Groups
#
# A group is a settings field that itself is a Settings object. You can use
# it to group settings fields in a hierarchy.
#
# Example:
#
#     class ServiceSettings < Toys::Settings
#       settings_attr :endpoint, default: "api.example.com"
#       settings_group :service_flags do
#         settings_attr :verbose, default: false
#         settings_attr :use_proxy, default: false
#       end
#     end
#
#     my_settings = ServiceSettings.new
#     my_settings.service_flags.verbose      # => false
#     my_settings.service_flags.verbose = true
#     my_settings.service_flags.verbose      # => true
#     my_settings.endpoint                   # => "api.example.com"
#
# You can define a group inline, as in the example above, or create an
# explicit settings class and use it for the group. For example:
#
#     class Flags < Toys::Settings
#       settings_attr :verbose, default: false
#       settings_attr :use_proxy, default: false
#     end
#     class ServiceSettings < Toys::Settings
#       settings_attr :endpoint, default: "api.example.com"
#       settings_group :service_flags, Flags
#     end
#
#     my_settings = ServiceSettings.new
#     my_settings.service_flags.verbose = true
#
# If the module enclosing a subclass of `Settings` is itself a subclass of
# `Settings`, then the class is automatically added to its enclosing class as
# a group. For example:
#
#     class ServiceSettings < Toys::Settings
#       settings_attr :endpoint, default: "api.example.com"
#       # Automatically adds this as the group service_flags.
#       # The name is inferred (snake_cased) from the class name.
#       class ServiceFlags < Toys::Settings
#         settings_attr :verbose, default: false
#         settings_attr :use_proxy, default: false
#       end
#     end
#
#     my_settings = ServiceSettings.new
#     my_settings.service_flags.verbose = true
#
# ### Type specifications
#
# A type specification is a restriction on the types of values allowed for a
# settings field. Every attribute has a type specification. You can set it
# explicitly by providing a `:type` argument or a block. If a type
# specification is not provided explicitly, it is inferred from the default
# value of the attribute.
#
# Type specifications can be any of the following:
#
#  *  A Module, restricting values to those that include the module.
#
#     For example, a type specification of `Enumerable` would accept `[123]`
#     but not `123`.
#
#  *  A Class, restricting values to that class or any subclass.
#
#     For example, a type specification of `Time` would accept `Time.now` but
#     not `DateTime.now`.
#
#     Note that some classes will convert (i.e. parse) strings. For example,
#     a type specification of `Integer` will accept the string `"-123"`` and
#     convert it to the value `-123`. Classes that support parsing include:
#
#      *  `Date`
#      *  `DateTime`
#      *  `Float`
#      *  `Integer`
#      *  `Regexp`
#      *  `Symbol`
#      *  `Time`
#
#  *  A Regexp, restricting values to strings matching the regexp.
#
#     For example, a type specification of `/^\w+$/` would match `"abc"` but
#     not `"abc!"`.
#
#  *  A Range, restricting values to objects that fall in the range and are
#     of the same class (or a subclass) as the endpoints. String values are
#     accepted if they can be converted to the endpoint class as specified by
#     a class type specification.
#
#     For example, a type specification of `(1..5)` would match `5` but not
#     `6`. It would also match `"5"` because the String can be parsed into an
#     Integer in the range.
#
#  *  A specific value, any Symbol, String, Numeric, or the values `nil`,
#     `true`, or `false`, restricting the value to only that given value.
#
#     For example, a type specification of `:foo` would match `:foo` but not
#     `:bar`.
#
#     (It might not seem terribly useful to have an attribute that can take
#     only one value, but this type is generally used as part of a union
#     type, described below, to implement an enumeration.)
#
#  *  An Array representing a union type, each of whose elements is one of
#     the above types. Values are accepted if they match any of the elements.
#
#     For example, a type specification of `[:a, :b :c]` would match `:a` but
#     not `"a"`. Similarly, a type specification of `[String, Integer, nil]`
#     would match `"hello"`, `123`, or `nil`, but not `123.4`.
#
#  *  A Proc that takes the proposed value and returns either the value if it
#     is legal, the converted value if it can be converted to a legal value,
#     or the constant {Toys::Settings::ILLEGAL_VALUE} if it cannot be
#     converted to a legal value. You may also pass a block to
#     `settings_attr` to set a Proc type specification.
#
#  *  A {Toys::Settings::Type} that checks and converts values.
#
# If you do not explicitly provide a type specification, one is inferred from
# the attribute's default value. The rules are:
#
#  *  If the default value is `true` or `false`, then the type specification
#     inferred is `[true, false]`.
#
#  *  If the default value is `nil` or not provided, then the type
#     specification allows any object (i.e. is equivalent to `Object`).
#
#  *  Otherwise, the type specification allows any value of the same class as
#     the default value. For example, if the default value is `""`, the
#     effective type specification is `String`.
#
# Examples:
#
#     class ServiceSettings < Toys::Settings
#       # Allows only strings because the default is a string.
#       settings_attr :endpoint, default: "example.com"
#     end
#
#     class ServiceSettings < Toys::Settings
#       # Allows strings or nil.
#       settings_attr :endpoint, default: "example.com", type: [String, nil]
#     end
#
#     class ServiceSettings < Toys::Settings
#       # Raises ArgumentError because the default is nil, which does not
#       # match the type specification. (You should either allow nil
#       # explicitly with `type: [String, nil]` or set the default to a
#       # suitable string such as the empty string "".)
#       settings_attr :endpoint, type: String
#     end
#
# ### Settings parents
#
# A settings object can have a "parent" which provides the values if they are
# not set in the settings object. This lets you organize settings as
# "defaults" and "overrides". A parent settings object provides the defaults,
# and a child can selectively override certain values.
#
# To set the parent for a settings object, pass it as the argument to the
# Settings constructor. When a field in a settings object is queried, it
# looks up the value as follows:
#
#  *  If a field value is explicitly set in the settings object, that value
#     is returned.
#  *  If the field is not set in the settings object, but the settings object
#     has a parent, the parent is queried. If that parent also does not have
#     a value for the field, it may query its parent in turn, and so forth.
#  *  If we encounter a root settings with no parent, and still no value is
#     set for the field, the default for the *original* setting is returned.
#
# Example:
#
#     class MySettings < Toys::Settings
#       settings_attr :str, default: "default"
#     end
#
#     root_settings = MySettings.new
#     child_settings = MySettings.new(root_settings)
#     child_settings.str        # => "default"
#     root_settings.str = "value_from_root"
#     child_settings.str        # => "value_from_root"
#     child_settings.str = "value_from_child"
#     child_settings.str        # => "value_from_child"
#     child_settings.str_unset!
#     child_settings.str        # => "value_from_root"
#     root_settings.str_unset!
#     child_settings.str        # => "default"
#
# Parents are honored through groups as well. For example:
#
#     class MySettings < Toys::Settings
#       settings_group :flags do
#         settings_attr :verbose, default: false
#         settings_attr :force, default: false
#       end
#     end
#
#     root_settings = MySettings.new
#     child_settings = MySettings.new(root_settings)
#     child_settings.flags.verbose       # => false
#     root_settings.flags.verbose = true
#     child_settings.flags.verbose       # => true
#
# Usually, a settings and its parent (and its parent, and so forth) should
# have the same class. This guarantees that they define the same fields with
# the same type specifications. However, this is not required. If a parent
# does not define a particular field, it is treated as if that field is
# unset, and lookup proceeds to its parent. To illustrate:
#
#     class Settings1 < Toys::Settings
#       settings_attr :str, default: "default"
#     end
#     class Settings2 < Toys::Settings
#     end
#
#     root_settings = Settings1.new
#     child_settings = Settings2.new(root_settings)  # does not have str
#     grandchild_settings = Settings1.new(child_settings)
#
#     grandchild_settings.str        # => "default"
#     root_settings.str = "value_from_root"
#     grandchild_settings.str        # => "value_from_root"
#
# Type specifications are enforced when falling back to parent values. If a
# parent provides a value that is not allowed, it is treated as if the field
# is unset, and lookup proceeds to its parent.
#
#     class Settings1 < Toys::Settings
#       settings_attr :str, default: "default"  # type spec is String
#     end
#     class Settings2 < Toys::Settings
#       settings_attr :str, default: 0  # type spec is Integer
#     end
#
#     root_settings = Settings1.new
#     child_settings = Settings2.new(root_settings)
#     grandchild_settings = Settings1.new(child_settings)
#

# Information about the source of a tool, such as the file, git repository,
# or block that defined it.
#
# This object represents a source of tool information and definitions. Such a
# source could include:
#
# * A toys directory
# * A single toys file
# * A file or directory loaded from git
# * A config block passed directly to the CLI
# * A tool block within a toys file
#
# The SourceInfo provides information such as the tool's context directory,
# and locates data and lib directories appropriate to the tool. It also
# locates the tool's source code so it can be reported when an error occurs.
#
# Each tool has a unique SourceInfo with all the information specific to that
# tool. Additionally, SourceInfo objects are arranged in a containment
# hierarchy. For example, a SourceInfo object representing a toys files could
# have a parent representing a toys directory, and an object representing a
# tool block could have a parent representing an enclosing block or a file.
#
# Child SourceInfo objects generally inherit some attributes of their parent.
# For example, the `.toys` directory in a project directory defines the
# context directory as that project directory. Then all tools defined under
# that directory will share that context directory, so all SourceInfo objects
# descending from that root will inherit that value (unless it's changed
# explicitly).
#
# SourceInfo objects can be obtained in the DSL from
# {Toys::DSL::Tool#source_info} or at runtime by getting the
# {Toys::Context::Key::TOOL_SOURCE} key. However, they are created internally
# by the Loader and should not be created manually.

# A template definition. Template classes should include this module.
#
# A template is a configurable set of DSL code that can be run in a toys
# configuration to automate tool defintion. For example, toys provides a
# "minitest" template that generates a "test" tool that invokes minitest.
# Templates will often support configuration; for example the minitest
# template lets you configure the paths to the test files.
#
# ### Usage
#
# To create a template, define a class and include this module.
# The class defines the "configuration" of the template. If your template
# has options/parameters, you should provide a constructor, and methods
# appropriate to edit those options. The arguments given to the
# {Toys::DSL::Tool#expand} method are passed to your constructor, and your
# template object is passed to any block given to {Toys::DSL::Tool#expand}.
#
# Next, in your template class, call the `on_expand` method, which is defined
# in {Toys::Template::ClassMethods#on_expand}. Pass this a block which
# defines the implementation of the template. Effectively, the contents of
# this block are "inserted" into the user's configuration. The template
# object is passed to the block so you have access to the template options.
#
# ### Example
#
# This is a simple template that generates a "hello" tool. The tool simply
# prints a `"Hello, #{name}!"` greeting. The name is set as a template
# option; it is defined when the template is expanded in a toys
# configuration.
#
#     # Define a template by creating a class that includes Toys::Template.
#     class MyHelloTemplate
#       include Toys::Template
#
#       # A user of the template may pass an optional name as a parameter to
#       # `expand`, or leave it as the default of "world".
#       def initialize(name: "world")
#         @name = name
#       end
#
#       # The template is passed to the expand block, so a user of the
#       # template may also call this method to set the name.
#       attr_accessor :name
#
#       # The following block is inserted when the template is expanded.
#       on_expand do |template|
#         desc "Prints a greeting to #{template.name}"
#         tool "templated-greeting" do
#           to_run do
#             puts "Hello, #{template.name}!"
#           end
#         end
#       end
#     end
#
# Now you can use the template in your `.toys.rb` file like this:
#
#     expand(MyHelloTemplate, name: "rubyists")
#
# or alternately:
#
#     expand(MyHelloTemplate) do |template|
#       template.name = "rubyists"
#     end
#
# And it will create a tool called "templated-greeting".

# Base class for defining tools
#
# This base class provides an alternative to the {Toys::DSL::Tool#tool}
# directive for defining tools in the Toys DSL. Creating a subclass of
# `Toys::Tool` will create a tool whose name is the "kebab-case" of the class
# name. Subclasses can be created only in the context of a tool configuration
# DSL. Furthermore, a class-defined tool can be created only at the top level
# of a configuration file, or within another class-defined tool. It cannot
# be a subtool of a tool block.
#
# ### Example
#
#     class FooBar < Toys::Tool
#       desc "This is a tool called foo-bar"
#
#       def run
#         puts "foo-bar called"
#       end

  #   Optional. If not specified, accepts any value as a string.
  # @param complete_flags [Object] A specifier for shell tab completion
  #   for flag names associated with this flag. By default, a
  #   {Toys::Flag::DefaultCompletion} is used, which provides the flag's
  #   names as completion candidates. To customize completion, set this to

  # @param key [String, Symbol] The key to use to retrieve the value from
  #   the execution context.
